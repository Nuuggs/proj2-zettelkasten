Code Review Notes from Michelle and Mike

Good points 
- Code is very clean. Variable and Function Naming is clear and consistent.
- Good handling of Promises and queries. 
- postNoteForm functionality is very well done. it handles consecutive promises in a very organized way. error checking is present.


Points to improve
- Add more comments, especially in the longer functions (e.g. postNoteForm), to describe the thinking behind the main steps in the function.
- normally, index.js contains all the app.get(...), and routes.js contains the route callbacks. yours are reversed. :D 
- include planning docs (ERD, user flow, wireframes) in a /planning_docs folder in the repo.
